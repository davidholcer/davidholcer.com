## What it does
Stitch scrapes all the chat data and time stamps from the Twitch stream. Then we run this data through a sentiment analysis model, and combine the frequency of message activity at a given timestamp with the sentiment score to determine the moments in your stream that got your audience's best reaction.
This data can then be turned into links to that specific time stamp for convenience. Then all the user has to do is select download on twitch for that highlighted segment, and they have their video.

##How we built it
We used the Twitch API to scrape chat data and timestamps during the stream. From there, we implemented a sentiment analysis model using VADER, which processes the chat data to identify the mood and reactions of the audience at each timestamp. The sentiment data is then combined with the frequency of messages to highlight key moments that had the highest engagement.

## My Contributions
I developed the engagement algorithm mathematically, conceptualizing the formula necessary to quantify engagement combining frequency and sentiment of chat data. Stylized front-end elements for modern and seamless user experience.

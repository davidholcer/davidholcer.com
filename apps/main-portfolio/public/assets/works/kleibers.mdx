Kleibers’s Law is a biological law, which states that an organism’s mass to the three-fourths power is proportional to its basal metabolic rate. I compared characteristics of Kleiber’s law with how growth aspects of a city scale with that city’s population using computer programming, and found that Kleiber's Law applies to model city growth, in some cases with higher certainty than in others.

# Example Blog Post with Media

This is an example blog post that demonstrates how to include various types of media in your content. Let's explore how images and videos work in our blog system.

## Including Images

You can include images using standard markdown syntax. Here's an example with the Mac logo:

![[image]][[/assets/images/mac_logo.png]]

The image above shows the Mac logo and demonstrates how images are rendered in our blog posts. Images are automatically optimized and responsive.

## Including Videos

Videos can also be embedded using our custom video syntax. Here's an example video:

![[video width=100%, height=auto, controls=true, autoPlay=false, muted=false]][[/assets/video/flip.mp4]]

## Code Examples

You can also include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Lists and Formatting

Here's an example of different formatting options:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `Inline code` for technical terms
- [Links](https://example.com) for references

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates the various media types and formatting options available in our blog system. You can:

1. Include images with standard markdown
2. Embed videos using our custom video syntax
3. Use code blocks with syntax highlighting
4. Format text with bold, italic, and other markdown features

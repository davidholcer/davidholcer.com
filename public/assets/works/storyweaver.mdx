## What it does
StoryWeaver.ai is a storytelling platform, enabling you to be the protagonist in an AI generated story that progresses via decisions you get to make throughout the experience. To initialize the story, you enter some background information about yourself, such as your name, mood, your initial action. This will begin the unique storytelling experience, which upon StoryWeaver.ai will give several possible options on how you as the character can proceed. Through a personalized AI generated plot, each story you get is unique, and the plot is unpredictable, making for an addicting new source of entertainment.

## How we built it
To build this project, we used Cohere's API to produce AI generated text that forms the foundation of the storytelling. To ensure the unique quality of the narrative, and reduce repetition throughout the story, we tested out many parameter variations that are most suitable depending on the nature of the AI output was desired. To create and design the online platform itself we used Node.js, React.js, tailwindcss and the Next framework.

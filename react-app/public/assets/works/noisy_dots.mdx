title: "Noisy Dots"
description: "A generative, interactive work in which colorful dots appear in square grids evenly spaced out within a larger square grid. A changing noise value determines the number of dots in each row and column, and their color. Interactive settings include noise speed, max number of points per row/column, total number of grids, and light/dark modes automatically determined based on current time."

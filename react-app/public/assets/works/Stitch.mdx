## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
The platform is built with a modern React-based frontend:

```javascript
// Real-time collaboration component
const CollaborativeCanvas = ({ projectId, userId }) => {
  const [canvas, setCanvas] = useState(null);
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const socket = io(`/project/${projectId}`);
    
    socket.on('user-joined', (user) => {
      setUsers(prev => [...prev, user]);
    });
    
    socket.on('canvas-update', (update) => {
      applyCanvasUpdate(update);
    });
    
    return () => socket.disconnect();
  }, [projectId]);
  
  return (
    <div className="canvas-container">
      <Canvas ref={canvas} />
      <UserPresence users={users} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Backend Services
The backend is built with Node.js and Express:

```javascript
// WebSocket handler for real-time collaboration
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('join-project', (projectId) => {
    socket.join(projectId);
    socket.to(projectId).emit('user-joined', {
      id: socket.userId,
      name: socket.userName
    });
  });
  
  socket.on('canvas-update', (update) => {
    socket.to(update.projectId).emit('canvas-update', update);
    saveToDatabase(update);
  });
});
```

### Database Design
The platform uses a hybrid database approach:

- **PostgreSQL**: User data, projects, and metadata
- **Redis**: Real-time session management and caching

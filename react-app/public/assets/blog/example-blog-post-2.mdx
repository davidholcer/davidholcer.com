# How do you do?

This is a test blog post to debug the footnote system.

## Introduction

Here's some text with a footnote![[footnote]][[This is a test [Link text Here](https://link-url-here.org) that should appear when clicked]] to see if the system is working properly.

## More Content

Here's another paragraph with another footnote![[footnote]][[This is the second footnote with some additional content to test the system]] to make sure everything works correctly.

## Code Example

```javascript
// This is a code block
function test() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Conclusion

This concludes our test of the footnote system. The footnotes should appear as popups when you click the numbers next to the text.

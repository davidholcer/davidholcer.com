# Example with New Syntax

This blog post demonstrates the new syntax for images and footnotes.

## Images with New Syntax

You can now include images using the new syntax:

![[image]][[/assets/images/mac_logo.png]]

The image above uses the new `![[image]][[path]]` syntax and will be automatically styled with rounded corners and shadow.

## Footnotes with New Syntax

You can include footnotes using the new syntax that checks for the word "footnote":

Here's some text with a footnote![[footnote]][[This is a footnote with a [link](https://example.com) 
and **bold text** and *italic text*.

This is a second line in the footnote.]]
![[newline]]
And here's another paragraph with another footnote![[footnote]][[This is the second footnote with some additional content to test the system.

This is another line in the second footnote.]] to make sure everything works correctly.

## Regular Content

You can still use regular markdown syntax for other content:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `Inline code` for technical terms
- [Regular links](https://example.com) still work

## Code Examples

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Conclusion

The new syntax provides:

1. **Image syntax**: `![[image]][[path]]` for easy image inclusion
2. **Footnote syntax**: `![[footnote]][[content]]` that only processes when "footnote" is in the first bracket
3. **Rich footnote content**: Support for links, bold, and italic text within footnotes
4. **Automatic styling**: Images get rounded corners and shadows automatically

This makes it much easier to include media and footnotes in your blog posts!
